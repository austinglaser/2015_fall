# Proces Models

## Planning is Everything

- How have you been writing code?
    - From start to finish
        - Requires you to know how to solve the problem before you start
        - Works for
            - Small programs
            - Experienced programmers
        - Doesn't work for
            - Large programs
            - Team-based projects

- Phases:
    - Requirements
    - Design
    - Implementation
    - Testing
    - Deployment
    - Maintenance
        - Most of the lifecycle of a project

## Models for development

- Waterfall
    - Each phase in sequence
    - No overlap
    - Difficulty accomodating change
    - Waterfall projects tend to fail
        - 18% cancelled
        - 53% late, overbudget, descoped
- Iterative
    - Iterate on waterfall
    - Subset of requirements each cycle
    - Common in startups
- Iterfall
    - Waterfall with backtracking
- Agile
    - Agile manifesto
        - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
        - Working software over comprehensive documentation
        - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
        - Responding to change over following a plan
