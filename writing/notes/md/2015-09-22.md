# Presentations

## NVIDIA Tesla: A Unified Graphics and Computing Architecture

1.  *What was the main idea of the presentation as you understood it?*

    -   NVIDIA, with "Tesla," integrated graphics processing instead of having
        separate vector/pixel processors
    -   Streaming processor a highly parallelized arithmetic unit
        -   Many integrated in a single graphics processor
    -   Focused on parallel computation (as opposed to CPU)
        -   Break problems into many concurrent parts
        -   Useful for scientific computing (protein folding, etc)

2.  *Identify a couple of things that you thought were particularly effective in this presentation.*

    -   GPU block-diagram graphics
    -   Very detailed
    -   I like the source code examples

3.  *Identify a couple of things that you think didn't work so well, and say how they could be improved.*

    -   Avoid reading directly from slides (can often stand so you can use your
    -   own computer screen as reference)
    -   Would have been great to see the two block-diagrams side-by-side
    -   A lot of unexplained jargon -- maybe move more slowly or focus on a
        specific point

## On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies (Einstein)

1.  *What was the main idea of the presentation as you understood it?*

    -   This was Einstein's breakthrough paper
    -   Lays out Special (as opposed to General) Relativity
    -   Two main points:
        -   Refute the idea of a "luminiferous aether"
        -   "Inertial reference framse:" no one "absolute" reference frame
    -   Postulates:
        -   Relativity (same rules no matter what the reference frame)
        -   Invariant and absolute light speed
    - Consequences:
        -   No absolute simultaneity
        -   Time dilation
        -   Length contraction
        -   Modern interpretation of Maxwell's equations for electrodynamics

2.  *Identify a couple of things that you thought were particularly effective in this presentation.*

    -   Love the thought experiments and explanations
    -   Good job looking at audience, projecting
    -   Posing questions at the end

3.  *Identify a couple of things that you think didn't work so well, and say how they could be improved.*

    -   Use of the word "prove" for (what was at the time) a purely theoretical
        paper. Maybe instead talk about deduction, theory, etc.
    -   Some explanations were a litle to general, esp. having to do with
        electrodynamics (hard problem because so much of this is very technical)

## Human Prion Protein Sequence Elements Impede Cross-Species Chronic Wasting Disease Transmission

1.  *What was the main idea of the presentation as you understood it?*

    - Background:
        -   A "prion" disease caused by malformed proteins
            -   Are NOT made non-infective by cooking or normal sterilization
                procedures
            -   Long gestation period (so long period where it's transmissible)
        -   Causes "spongiform" tissue in brain - like swiss cheese
        -   Chronic Wasting Disease: prion disease in deer and elk
        -   Theories of transmission:
            -   Males fighting
            -   Sexual
            -   Maternal
            -   Waste to plants to ingestion
    - Experiment:
        -   Inject CWD prions into two groups of mice: one with elk gene group,
            one without
            -   Same thing with mad cow disease
                -   Elk-gene mice postponed disease presentation

2.  *Identify a couple of things that you thought were particularly effective in this presentation.*

    -   Natural-feeling speaking style
    -   Very thorough and understandable explanation of core experiment

3.  *Identify a couple of things that you think didn't work so well, and say how they could be improved.*

    -   Reading off slides/notes -- try to make more eye contact with audience
    -   The end got deeply technical, and I lost the overall point (though this
        is far from my area of expertise).

## Expressive Language Profiles of Verablly Expressive Adolescents and Young Adults With Downs Syndrome and Fragile X Syndrome

1.  *What was the main idea of the presentation as you understood it?*

    -   Background:
        -   Two diseases rooted in genetic defects
            -   Fragile X:  Defect in X chromosome
            -   Downs:      Extra chromosome(s?)
    -   Experiment:
        -   Looked at verbal expression in these two diseases
        -   Compared gender expression (specifically with Fragile X)
        -   Participants needed "basic proficiency" in english
        -   Administered nonverbal IQ test and a language test
        -   Found gender correlation, which has inspired further research

2.  *Identify a couple of things that you thought were particularly effective in this presentation.*

    -   Concise explanation of the results
    -   Clean slide layout

3.  *Identify a couple of things that you think didn't work so well, and say how they could be improved.*

    -   Could use more graphics, fewer words on slides
    -   Acronyms never explicitly defined
    -   Would be interesting to hear more about the test specifics
