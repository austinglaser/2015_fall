## Clinical Applications of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (2013)

1.  *What was the main idea of the presentation as you understood it?*

    -   Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) can (in layman terms) turn into other
        types of cells
        -   Not immortal, but expand manyfold
        -   Can differentiate into other cell classes
        -   Adult stem cells (vs. embryonic)
            -   Predominately from bone marrow
    -   Mostly have been studied in vitro (as opposed to in vivo)
        -   In vivo studies have shown positive results
        -   Unclear if those results are directly due to cell differentiation
    -   As treatment:
        -   Cardiovascular disease
        -   Autoimmune disease
        -   Liver disease
        -   Stem-cell treatments are compelling, but are complex and still have
            extant problems
            -   Side effects, rejection, etc

2.  *Identify a couple of things that you thought were particularly effective in this presentation.*

    -   Very clean slide layout
    -   Good eye contact

3.  *Identify a couple of things that you think didn't work so well, and say how they could be improved.*

    -   A lot of jargon which was never defined (consider audience of not
        medical people, maybe put in more layman terms)
    -   A great deal of data for a 15-minute presentation -- maybe it could have
        been pared down
    -   Some terms mispronounced (metastasis, in vitro)

## Robots approaching Self-Consciousness and The 'Sinbularity

1.  *What was the main idea of the presentation as you understood it?*

    -   AI defined as a system which has:
        -   Visual Perception
        -   Speech Recognition
        -   Decision making (?)
        -   Language translation
    -   If we create a true AI, it may be better at creating future artificial
        intelligences then we are
        -   This is the idea behind 'the singularity'
        -   Theorized to be an exponential or psuedo-exponential process
    -   Natural language recognition is fairly advanced
        -   Cannot really carry out intelligent conversation
    -   We have good sensors
    -   Making forward progress, but a long way to go

2.  *Identify a couple of things that you thought were particularly effective in this presentation.*

    -   Compelling premise
    -   Cool examples (robots and worms)

3.  *Identify a couple of things that you think didn't work so well, and say how they could be improved.*

    -   Very interessting (I'm sure) technical data, but EXTREMELY difficult to
        interpret in the time we're given
    -   A lot of 'fuzzy' statements (talking about 'common sense', etc) that
        detract from the really interesting parts (demonstrating some level of
        self-awareness in a robot)

## Applying Personal Genetic Data to Injury Risk in Athletes

1.  *What was the main idea of the presentation as you understood it?*

    -   Paper's goal: Expand the knowledge of genetics in sports
        -   Identified 124 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, or genetic
            markers) associated with sports inuries
        -   Categorize SNPs based on specific injuries
        -   Observe athletes' responses to knowledge about genetics etc
    -   SNPs:
        -   Most common type of genetic variation
        -   A C A to A T A, for example
    -   Aggregated data about many identified SNPs
    -   Athletes given data about their genetic makeup and risk factors,
        surveyed to see if behavior changed

2.  *Identify a couple of things that you thought were particularly effective in this presentation.*

    -   Clean slide layout
    -   Good supporting graphics

3.  *Identify a couple of things that you think didn't work so well, and say how they could be improved.*

    -   A lot of repetition of data -- more time could have been spent
        organizing the slides so that there was a cleaner flow.
    -   Presenters did a lot of reading directly from their slides
