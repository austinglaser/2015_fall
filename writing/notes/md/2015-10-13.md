# Paper Feedback

## Data

-   Is technically plural
    -   CAN be correct to use as singular, as long as document is consistent
    -   Technically, singular is 'datum'
-   'dataset' vs 'data set'
    -   Still in flux since this is generally a new term
    -   Again, consistency is the most important thing
    -   Interesting NGram for this comparison
        -   'dataset' definitely on the rise in last 2 decades

## Quotes: verbatim vs. paraphrase

-   When do we use one vs. the other?
    -   Verbatim:
        -   If need to analyse precise wording, etc
        -   If quotation can't be improved upon for your purposes, esp. for
            brevity
    -   Paraphrase:
        -   If a summary is sufficient, extra detail would be unnecessary and
            cluttering
        -   Summarizing data, etc
        -   "classic" scientific paper style: unquoted summarizing sentence with
            terminating inline reference (author, yyyy).
-   Important to cite in EITHER case if ideas are not original!

## Terms

-   Important to define terms which are unfamiliar
    -   Not to yourself or to those in your field, but to general scientific
        community
    -   gloss (v.): To provide a brief, general explanation of term
        -   Orin recommends a quick inline gloss at first usage of the term
        -   Could also include formal glossary
    -   Also (especially) includes acronyms

# In-class reading

-   "The Curse of Knowledge"
    -   Writers don't realize their audiences base level of knowledge
    -   "Close the loop;" get feedback, rewrite, repeat until setpoint reached
    -   Can also leave writing alone; return to it after some time
